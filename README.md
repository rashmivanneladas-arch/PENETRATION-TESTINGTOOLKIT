Penetration Testing Toolkit 
Description:
A comprehensive Python-based penetration testing toolkit designed for security assessment and vulnerability identification. This modular system integrates four essential security testing modules into a unified interface for efficient cybersecurity evaluation.

Key Modules:

1. Port Scanner - Identifies open ports and running services on target systems
2. Directory Buster - Discovers hidden directories and files on web servers
3. Vulnerability Scanner - Detects SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
4. Brute Forcer - Tests authentication systems with common password dictionaries
Technical Implementation:
Built using Python with requests for HTTP operations, socket for network communication, and integrated error handling. Features a color-coded command-line interface with clear reporting and demo-safe testing capabilities.
Educational Value:
Demonstrates practical application of cybersecurity testing methodologies while emphasizing ethical usage for authorized environments only. Provides hands-on experience with common penetration testing techniques used in real-world security assessments.
Use Case: Security professionals, ethical hackers, and developers can use this toolkit to identify security weaknesses in their own systems, promoting proactive security hardening and awareness.
