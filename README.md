Penetration Testing Toolkit 
Description:
A comprehensive Python-based penetration testing toolkit designed for security assessment and vulnerability identification. This modular system integrates four essential security testing modules into a unified interface for efficient cybersecurity evaluation.

Key Modules:

1. Port Scanner - Identifies open ports and running services on target systems
2. Directory Buster - Discovers hidden directories and files on web servers
3. Vulnerability Scanner - Detects SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
4. Brute Forcer - Tests authentication systems with common password dictionaries
Technical Implementation:
Built using Python with requests for HTTP operations, socket for network communication, and integrated error handling. Features a color-coded command-line interface with clear reporting and demo-safe testing capabilities.
